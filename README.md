# EXAMING-DATA-BREACH-AND-ETHICAL-CHALLENGES-IN-EXPEDIA-S-DATA-PRACTICES

This project analyzes significant data security and ethical challenges faced by Expedia, including a 2020 data breach caused by a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket, exposing millions of personal records. It also examines allegations of unauthorized data sharing with affiliates and competitors, highlighting deficiencies in data governance and security practices. Using a combination of operational, technical, legal, and ethical frameworks, the report provides actionable recommendations such as implementing advanced encryption, robust access controls, and comprehensive data governance policies to address vulnerabilities. These measures aim to enhance compliance with regulations like CCPA and PCI DSS, rebuild customer trust, and uphold Expedia's reputation in the digital age.
